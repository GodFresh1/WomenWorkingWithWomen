        Belinda Smith is known as a trail blazer in her own right.
        For 23 years she enjoyed her career in Dialysis {end stage
        renal disease}. She began her internship as a technician
        and later became an active advocate for all dialysis technicians
        nationally. As a supervisory dialysis trainer she was then appointed
        to the Board of Directors of the National Association of Nephrology
        Technicians/Technology. After her appointment to the Board she was
        voted to be the first Black female president in its presidency history.
        While in that position, she fostered a partnership with the American
        Nephrology Nursing Association {ANNA}, where they collaborated and
        developed a training DVD to be used by all dialysis technicians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Belinda later went on to be a dialysis clinical specialist for many
        laboratories across the country, where she provided educational
        in-services, seminars, and workshops. After working as a clinical
        specialist for many years Belinda decided moved to Gainesville, Florida
        to follow her passion as a seminar presenter. God continued to lead her
        on her professional journey as she became involved in the women’s
        ministry for the Southeastern Conference. It was here that she was
        offered an opportunity to follow this new ministry by providing
        workshops and seminars that covered SEC District One’s areas of Georgia
        and Florida. This included 22 churches and where her ministry flourished
        for 11 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her objective is to empower women, teens, and families by providing the
        tools needed to establish and maintain healthy families and strong relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past three and a half years, God has allowed her to pursue
        entrepreneurial work which fulfills her passions. God has also met
        every need in forming the organization “Women Working With Women, Inc.”
