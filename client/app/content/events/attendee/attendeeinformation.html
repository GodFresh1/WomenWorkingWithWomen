      <p>
        Hello wonderful women of God! We are pleased that you are interested in attending the 2016 Women Working With Women Conference. The information provided below will give you an idea of what to expect during the conference and hopefully answer most of your questions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>When, Where, and Why?</h5>
      <p><b>When:</b> July 15 2:00PM- July 17, 2016 2:00PM</p>

      <p>1714 SW 34th Street, Gainesville FL, 32307</p>
      <p><b>Why:</b> As women sometimes we tend to get lost in all of the roles we play as mothers, daughters, wives, students, career women, and everything else in between. This conference will provide all of us with the tools to take our lives back, get our life on track, and live our best lives with the Lord.<p>
      <br>
      <h5>What Should I Expect?</h5>
      <p>The 2016 Women Working With Women Conference is designed to be a get-away weekend for women of all ages. This is your time to relax, fellowship with other women, and most importantly, reconnect with our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p>The conference will cater to three types of women: women, pastor’s wives, and teens (ages 13-17). We have inspiring, spirit-filled, workshops, general sessions, and praise and worship planned for you. We will have a vendors exhibit, prizes, a banquet fit for a queen, and other activities that will have you feeling relaxed, rejuvenated, and on fire for God. </p>
      <br>
      <h5>What Should I Bring?</h5>

      <p>• Bring what you would normally bring for a 3 day get away weekend.</p>
      <p>We do plan to have a banquet on Saturday night as well as a fashion show. The banquet is formal attire.

      <p>• Formal banquet attire</p>
      <p>• Don't forget your camera!</p>
      <p>• Your best attitude and an open mind =)</p>
      <br>
      <h5>Where Should I Stay?</h5>
      <p>It is important to note that lodging is not included in your registration cost.
